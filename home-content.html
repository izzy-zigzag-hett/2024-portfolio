            <p>
              I created this video for a class at RISD in 4 weeks. It was inspired by a podcast my dad sent to me that explained the mystery of the chrysalis goop. I was shocked to learn about this at my grown age, and thought others would enjoy learning it too.
              I created the video from script to final cut, and got immense positive feedback upon sharing it with my community. This was the first animation project I ever made at this length and level of polish, and my skills have only grown from here.
              I hope to make more science videos in the future, as the reception indicated people enjoyed my presentation of this fun fact as much as I enjoyed making it.

          The goal with these animations was to create enough subtle movement to catch an onlooker's eye, but not distract from the experience of reading the content. These animations took iterative feedback from the team's creative director in order to find that equilibrium.

            The designs were made in Adobe Illustrator, including original logos and illustrations. I took inspiration from 90s and 2000s toy packaging to produce a nostalgia effect.
            The toys and their packages were created to be displayed in a fine-art setting rather than be produced for consumers. This enabled me to be very maximalist and hide some humor in the packaging.
            Despite this context, I did get an interesting introduction to package design and learned a lot about the process of recoloring and shifting assets around to fit hyper-specific printing dimensions.

              <i>Greenhouse Consulting</i> Logo Design Exersize, 2021
          </h3>
          <p class="text">
            These logo designs were created in an illustration concepts class. They are an early but solid example of my logo and branding design skills.
            <br><br> My goal was to for the designs to feel modern and professional, with a bit of a "down-to-earth" illustrative touch.

                The Bedtime Heroes are a band of friendly critter-shaped toys that come to life at night to help various children fight off the Shadow Shufflers, which are manifestations of a child's fears.
                <i>Bedtime Heroes</i> was concieved by me in Spring of 2023 for an independent study project at RISD in which I wanted to explore the concept of a cute franschise with nefarious undertones.
                I created many types of media for this project, including 2D and 3D animations, 3D printed and mock-packaged toys, plushies, and even an immersive "playcave."

                    This video is an attempt at creating an animated intro to the TV show itself from my made-up franchise. This process involved creating an original soundtrack using Ableton Live, 
                    as well as storyboarding and animating the project myself. I specifically wanted to challenge my typical workflow by animating the majority of it directly in After Effects, with just a few 
                    hand-drawn elements. I also enjoyed playing with textures and lighting to create a dream-like cut-paper effect.
